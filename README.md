# dosage CPU
Dosage is a 20bit single cycle RISC CPU based on Harvard architecture with no cache or pipeline, <br />
by having a very simple and reduced instruction set it can be used for educational purposes  <br />

# ISA
Phase 1 cpu designed in logicism with a  reduced instruction set <br />

# Assembler
phase 2 <br />
We also write an assembler in order to run assembly on dosage <br />
You can find it Python file. <br />

# hardware_description 
phase 3 <br />
This hardware is also described in Verilog <br />
so we can build dosage in the physical world too!

# next:
running C on this CPU
